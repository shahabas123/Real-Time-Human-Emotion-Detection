Real-Time Human Emotion Detection

Description

This project is a Streamlit-based web application for detecting human emotions in real-time through webcam feed. It uses OpenCV for face detection, TensorFlow for the emotion recognition model, and a pre-trained model trained on the FER2013 dataset. The application can recognize emotions like Angry, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Fear, Neutral, and Disgust.
